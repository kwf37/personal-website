I am currently working at American Express, creating financial planning apps
such as SpendSmart. I work on our Kotlin backend and React+Typescript frontend.

I came to Amex as a part of the acquisition of Bodeswell, and we continue to make
tools to democratize financial planning.

I take an active role in my team by proposing new design patterns, optimizing our
backend's performance, improving Amex's engineering process, while introducing interesting
technology such as Nix along the way.
