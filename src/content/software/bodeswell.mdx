I worked for a short time at Bodeswell, which was a startup working on
a financial planning application that helped users create financial plans
for their lives.

Bodeswell let users link their accounts, and then displayed a timeline of
their net worth over the span of their lifetime. They could then add life
events to their timeline, such as having children, saving for retirement, buying a house, etc.
Bodeswell would then provide information and calculations for how much one would
need to save to meet their goals.

I worked on the Kotlin backend for a month until Bodeswell was acquired by
American Express.
