I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Cornell University.
There, I did research and TA'd classes on computer architecture and programming languages.

I went in to Cornell wanting to understand how computers work, and
I came out of it with an interest in the common abstractions that pop up across _both_
software and hardware.
